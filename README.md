**Wes Tamagi**
I'm a sociology teacher and I'm starting my journey to change my career, 
I defend Open Source Technology for humanities causes.
My first OS 🐧 at this moment is _EndevourOS_, but I very like PeppermintOS and PCLinuxOS and my favorite DE is Xfce 🐁 and Plasma
[Xfce with Plasma wow!!] 
I like challenges. Should learn two or more projects at the same time?   Yes, it's a crazy idea but very fun!

My favorites programming languages are:
Julia
Python
Java/Kotlin
JS/Typescript

# If you are curious about authors of sociology, especially Durkheim and Simmel or Brazilian culture ask me let's exchange letters #
